Remove dups in a large text file, while preserving order (sort and then uniq will do it without keeping order)
awk '!seen[$0]++' input.txt > output.txt

Subtract a small list (e.g., swear words) from a large list (e.g., dictionary)
grep -vwf <(sed 's/^/^\\b/; s/$/\\b$/' small.txt) large.txt > filtered.txt

Subtract lines that contain an apostrophe
grep -v \' input.txt > output.txt
or a period
grep -v '\.' input.txt > output.txt
